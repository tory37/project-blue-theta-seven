# Trello Integration

This project uses a Trello-based workflow for managing tasks, bugs, and features directly through the Gemini CLI.

## Available Skills

### 1. Trello Card Management (`/djt-trello`)
Use this for lightweight management of cards across your Trello board.

- **List/Retrieve**: `/djt-trello [bugs|techdebt|backlog]`
  - Fetches the top card from the specified column.
  - Moves the card to **DOING**.
  - Assigns you to the card.
- **Add Card**: `/djt-trello add [bugs|techdebt|backlog]`
  - Creates a new card with standard templates for Acceptance Criteria and Test Plans.

## Configuration

The tools are configured to work with the following Trello setup:
- **Board ID**: `QSqmJAA7`
- **MCP Config**: `.agents/mcp/trello.json`

Ensure your local `.env` file contains the required `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_TOKEN`. You can find the specific required keys in `.env.trello.example`.

## Troubleshooting

If the skills are not responding, ensure that the `trello` MCP server is correctly registered in your Gemini CLI configuration and that your Trello token has not expired.
